**Abstract**

**Background**: High blood pressure (BP) is a key modifiable determinant of cardiovascular disease and a likely
determinant of other adverse health outcomes. While socioeconomic inequalities in BP are well documented, it
remains unclear (1) how these inequalities have changed across time, given improvements over time in the
detection and treatment of high BP (hypertension); (2) whether BP inequalities are present below and above
hypertension treatment thresholds; and (3) whether socioeconomic position (SEP) across life has cumulative effects
on BP. We sought to address these gaps using evidence from two complementary sources: birth cohort and
repeated cross-sectional datasets.

**Methods**: We used three British birth cohort studies—born in 1946, 1958, and 1970—with BP measured at 43–46
years (in 1989, 2003, and 2016), and 21 repeated cross-sectional datasets—the Health Survey for England (HSE), with
BP measured among adults aged ≥ 25 years (1994–2016). Adult education attainment was used as an indicator of
SEP in both datasets; childhood father’s social class was used as an alternative indicator of (early life) SEP in cohorts.
Adjusting for the expected average effects of antihypertensive medication use, we used linear regression to
quantify SEP differences in mean systolic BP (SBP), and quantile regression to investigate whether inequalities
differed across SBP distributions—below and above hypertension treatment thresholds.

**Results**: In both datasets, lower educational attainment was associated with higher SBP, with similar absolute
magnitudes of inequality across the studied period. Differences in SBP by education (Slope Index of Inequality)
based on HSE data were 3.0 mmHg (95% CI 1.8, 4.2) in 1994 and 4.3 mmHg (2.3, 6.3) in 2016. Findings were similar
for diastolic BP (DBP) and survey-defined hypertension. Inequalities were found across the SBP distribution in both
datasets—below and above the hypertension threshold—yet were larger at the upper tail; in HSE, median SBP
differences were 2.8 mmHg (1.7, 3.9) yet 5.6 mmHg (4.9, 6.4) at the 90th quantile. Adjustment for antihypertensive
medication use had little impact on the magnitude of inequalities; in contrast, associations were largely attenuated
after adjustment for body mass index. Finally, cohort data suggested that disadvantage in early and adult life had
cumulative independent associations with BP: cohort-pooled differences in SBP were 5.0 mmHg (3.8, 6.1) in a score
combining early life social class and own education, yet were 3.4 mmHg (2.4, 4.4) for education alone.

**Conclusion**: Socioeconomic inequalities in BP have persisted from 1989 to 2016 in Britain/England, despite
improved detection and treatment of high BP. To achieve future reductions in BP inequalities, policies addressing
the wider structural determinants of high BP levels are likely required, particularly those curtailing the obesogenic
environment—targeting detection and treatment alone is unlikely to be sufficient.
